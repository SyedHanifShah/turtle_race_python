# Python Turtle Race

This project uses Python's built-in turtle module to simulate a turtle race. A random walk is a mathematical object, known as a stochastic or random process, that describes a path consisting of a succession of race steps.



### Getting Started
To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

Prerequisites
This project requires Python 3.7 and above. You can download Python from the official website:

Python Official Site
The turtle module comes pre-installed with Python so no additional installation is necessary.

### Installation
1. Clone the repository
       
        git clone https://github.com/SyedHanifShah/turtle_race_python.git


2. Navigate to the project directory
        
        cd Truttle_graphic

3. Run the Python script
        
        python main.py


## Usage

This project can be used to visualize a random walk in two dimensions. When run, the script creates a turtle and moves it in one of four directions: up, down, left, or right. The direction is chosen randomly at each step. The turtle leaves a trail behind it as it moves, allowing you to see the path it took.
